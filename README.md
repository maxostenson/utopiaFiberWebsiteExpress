## CSS
Contains all CSS files for the website 

**NOTE:** Currently only really works on mobile. More work needed if desktop functionality desired. 
## Public
This directory should contain all public assets available to the site that need to be accessible to the index file. Currently, this only contains the images needed for the site.
### Images
All images needed for the site are in here
## Views
This directory contains each view that the frontend may serve to the user. All of these are written in the .pug format and can be used as templates for other views that need to be created.
## Index
This is the main directory that does all of the logic for the site. If new endpoints are needed, or new data must be pulled from the database, it will be changed here.
